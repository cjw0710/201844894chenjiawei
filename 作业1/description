VSM and KNN
project description
Preprocess the text dataset to and get a VSM representation of each text
Implement the KNN classifier and test its effect on 20Newsgroups.

Requirements
python==3.5
numpy
nltk and nltk data
Other required packages

File introduction
VSM.py:
Divide the data set, 80% for the training set and 20% for the data set. 
Perform a 5-fold cross-validation on 80% of the data set, and divide it into 5 copies, and execute them in sequence.
The document content is segmented, punctuation, lowercase, stemming, etc.
Traverse the document statistics word frequency, removing less than 4 low frequency words, and obtaining a dictionary.
Clean the file according to the dictionary and remove the words that are not included in the dictionary.

IFIDFcompute.py:
Calculate IDF, then calculate TF-IDF.

KNN:
Load the TFIDF of the training dictionary and process the TFIDF of the test data.
Use cosine similarity to calculate the vector distance between the test document and all training samples.
Find the class with the largest distance and calculate the correct rate of the test data set.
